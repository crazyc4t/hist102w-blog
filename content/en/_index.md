# Final Project 

{{< figure src="images/sfu-logo.png" alt="SFU Logo" >}}

This will be used as my final project for HIST102W (Canada since confederation) course at SFU.
As a mathematics and computing joint major, I decided to be a bit creative and do what I know best, code a blog with 3 posts that overview the Chinese head tax in Canada, focusing on primary sources and an overview of the survivors and families affected today.

Primary sources being documents, letters and newspapers from the time it happened is the best way to revisit our history regarding the Chinese Immigration Act which is important to acknowledge in order to support the affected families today and learn from our mistakes in order not to let it happen.
