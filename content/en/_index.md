# My blog

This will be used as my final project for HIST102W (Canada since confederation) course at SFU.
As a mathematics and computing joint major, I decided to be a bit creative and do what I know best, code a blog with 3 posts that overview the Chinese head tax in Canada, focusing on primary sources and an overview of the survivors and families affected today.
