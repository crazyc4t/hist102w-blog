### The Proposed Chinese Wall

{{< figure src="images/cartoon.png" caption="This 1896 cartoon from The Globe newspaper likens the Chinese head tax to a physical wall: “If this isn’t high enough, we’ll put it higher!”"  alt="Cartoon" class="center" >}}

This cartoon was published in the newspaper to reflect the Chinese head tax as a physical wall, resembling the price of the tax as the height of the wall which also shows that they will raise the height of the wall, implying that they will raise the tax price as much as they need to increase it in order to stop chinese immigration.  Since the racist idea of “White Canada Forever” as referenced in the textbook was growing quite strong then, the tax was used to keep chinese immigration out of Canada which this cartoon shows the perspective that the media back then wanted to place into Canadians mind that is Canada being a big, free country with room for people that want to become citizens of the country and loyally contribute to their society, but as the cartoon says “No room for aliens”, referring to anyone that is not white as aliens, meaning that Canada is not their home and they are not welcomed (The Globe 1896).

To feed this idea, the chart that the Chinese person drawn on the cartoon says that Chinese immigrate for the only purpose of gaining money and that they have no intentions whatsoever to pursue citizenship, instead it refers Canada as a “Country of the barbarians” so that Canadian people that read the newspaper, assuming that most of them were white, will create this bias that Chinese immigrants refers them as barbarian, which for a country trying to have a modern society can be quite the insult (The Globe 1896).

The bag of the Chinese person says “Chinese prejudices, customs and superstitions”, which reflects what a Chinese person brings in the eye of a Canadian settler, that are customs, prejudices and superstitions, which shows that by simply being Chinese, Canadians were assuming that they were raised in a culture that was built on ignorance, irrationality and primitive beliefs (The Globe 1896).


Relevance of the source:

Who is the author?

The author itself may be unknown since the signature is not linked to any artist, but for sure is an illustrator working for The Globe, the newspaper who published the cartoon. The Globe was a prominent Canadian newspaper of that time until today, who focused on economic and political issues, which in that time, the liberal party had just one the federal election having Wilfrid Laurier as it’s prime minister, making The Globe views biased regarding this topic due to the political pressure of the anti-chinese idea, making them reinforce this tax.

Why did they write the source?
Back then cartoons were powerful tools to shape public opinion since they were easy to read and by having drawings you can understand the context of it better than reading an article about it, because reading was a privilege back then due to many people not knowing how to read and write. They created this cartoon to reinforce the public opinion of restricting chinese immigration and also to show support to this idea since the government at that time which was the liberal party wanted to restrict even more Chinese immigration.


Who was the intended audience?
Being The Globe an economical and business centered newspaper who was read mostly by middle to high class white Canadians, but also taking in consideration that the source is a cartoon, designed to be read by the general public, the intended audience were Canadian citizens, but particularly British Columbians since this matter was happening primarily in BC. Being more specific, since it’s a cartoon the intended audience would be low to middle class British Columbians to fuel the idea of Chinese immigrants taking their jobs and doing it for lower wages, so they can support the liberal party at that time who they were supporting this claim of restricting Chinese immigration.


What assumptions does the cartoon make?
The assumption that the cartoon makes is that Chinese immigration is a problem that needs to be managed, does not matter what it takes, which the cartoon itself proposes a solution to raise the tax. Assumes as well that all readers which must be mostly Canadian have the same bias that they are superior compared to Chinese, that they are good, loyal men and women to their country and that the Chinese are immigrating to steal jobs and do work for less since they are plan to go back home and not improve the country, so in that way they can push this idea even further.


Are there any unspoken assumptions in the text?
The whole audience are Canadians since if a Chinese reads that, it would be an insult to them, but well they did not care at all if they read it, their mission is to popularize offensive stereotypes into Canadians. 




What worldview does the cartoon reflect?
Reflects and pushes a negative worldview that is racist and offensive, being the idea of Canadians having a bias and stereotyping Chinese immigrants as ignorants, primitives because of their superstitions and prejudices and because of that their immigration is a threat to their country so the head tax is a good thing for Canadians and if it should rise to restrict even more then is a good idea to do so.


Is there a detectable world view?
Yes there is, as stated before, the underlying assumption of Canadian people being superior to the Chinese, therefore the immigration of them being a problem.


When was the source created?
The source was created in 1896, right after the Chinese Immigration Act came into effect in 1885, reinforcing the idea of restricting Chinese immigration.


What is the historic context in which the source was written and read?
The historic context as previously mentioned is right after the Chinese Immigration Act came into effect, where the idea of Chinese immigrants being a problem for the country was already there, so the source just fuels that idea.
