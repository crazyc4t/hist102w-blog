This sections is where the blogposts can be found tackling three research questions:

- How did Canadian media and advertisements contribute to the portrayal of Chinese workers as uncivilized and solely motivated by money?

- In what ways did white Canadians accuse Chinese immigrants of being superstitious or racist, and how does this reveal a deeper racial hypocrisy?

- What has been the long-term impact of the Head Tax on Chinese Canadian families, and how do surviving members reflect on their experiences today?

I will have three blogposts that tackle these three questions and my primary source assignment in a blogpost format for completion as well.
